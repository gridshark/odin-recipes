    <h2>Experience the magic of one of the world's greatest soups with this traditional recipe!</h2>

        <p>As Old Man Winter uses his snowy white beard to wipe the landscape clean for a fresh new canvas, I enjoy preparing a bracing Vietnamese Pho soup.</p>

        <p>Don’t get it twisted! There are a lot of bustas out there on the internet posting half-assed Americanized knockoffs of the legit recipes. Don’t put any stock into them. Below, I’ve included one that highlights some of the key techniques that take a good Pho and make it great: Roasting your bones & charring aromatics, incorporating an intoxicating harmony of spices, and taking the time to let the broth develop its rich complexity. It’s as easy as 1, 2, 3, …no, I’d better not say it...</p>
        
        <p>It’s customary to slice your beef wicked thin against the grain by partially freezing it before cutting, then using the super hot broth to cook it when it is served as opposed to cooking the meat prior to serving.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <h4>Aromatics</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>2 large onions, halved</li>

                <li>2 pounds meaty beef bones</li>
                <li>2 pounds marrow bones (leg, knuckle) cut to reveal the marrow. If you have dogs, grab a couple extra for them too.</li>
                <li>1 pound beef tenderloin, frozen and sliced very thin</li>
            </ul>

                <li>3 Tablespoons fish sauce</li></ul>
        <h4>Noodles & Toppings</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1.5 ounces dried rice sticks. Use medium size - not super thin like vermicelli or really wide like Pad See Ew.</li>
                <li>1 handful bean sprouts</li>
                <li>3-5 sprigs Thai basil</li>
                <li>1 bundle cilantro</li>

                <li>Sriracha</li>
            </ul>

    <h3>Getting Started</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a heavy based skillet over high heat (no oil) until smoking.</li>
            <li>Place onion and ginger in pan cut side down. Cook for a few minutes until it's charred, then turn. Remove and set aside.</li>
            <li>Toast spices lightly in a dry skillet over medium high heat for 3 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
   <h3>Remove Impurities</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse bones & brisket then cover with water in large stock pot.</li>
            <li>Boil for 5 minutes, then drain.</li>
            <li>Rinse each bone and brisket under tap water.</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>Prepare the Broth</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wipe pot clean, bring 3.5 litres / 3.75 quarts water to boil.</li>
            <li>Add bones and brisket, onion, ginger, spices.</li>
            <li>Add onion, ginger, spices, sugar and salt - water should just barely cover everything.</li>
            <li>Cover with lid, simmer 3 hours.</li>
            <li>Remove brisket (should be fall-apart tender), cool then refrigerate for later.</li>
            <li>Simmer remaining soup UNCOVERED for 40 minutes.</li>
            <li>Strain broth into another pot, discard bones and spices. Should be about 10 cups, if loads more, reduce.</li>
            <li>Add fish sauce, adjust salt and sugar if needed. Broth should be beefy, fragrant with spices, savory and barely sweet.</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>Assemble the Soup</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare rice noodles per packet, just prior to serving.</li>
            <li>Place noodles in bowl. Top with raw beef tenderloin and brisket.</li>
            <li>Ladle over about 2 cups piping hot broth - will cook beef to medium rare.</li>
            <li>Serve with Toppings on the side!
            </li>
        </ol>
