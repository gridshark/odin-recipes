        <h3>A delicious dish fresh from the Metal Fingers Kitchen</h3>
           
        <p>As everyone knows, Rapp Snitch Knishes are traditionally made with rats and/or stool pigeons. Unfortunately, I couldn’t find any of those at my local grocer, so I decided ground beef would be a good substitute. I took some liberties with the filling and made a kind of freestyle chopped cheese. I originally went with just seasoned ground beef, some hot peppers, onions, and cheese but that version came out too dry. Turns out there is a reason knishes have mashed potatoes in them. It adds moisture to the mix helping the pastry cook lighter and a better mouthfeel for the filling. Not traditional for chopped cheese, but there’s nothing very traditional about any of this recipe.</p>
<h4>Ingredients:</h4>

<h5>For the dough</h5>
<ul>
    <li>2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more as needed
    </li>
    <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt
    </li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder
    </li>
    <li>1 large egg, beaten
    </li>
    <li>1 teaspoon white vinegar
    </li>
    <li>1/2 cup canola oil
    </li>
    <li>1/2 cup warm water
    </li></ul>

    <h5>For the Filling:</h5>
    <ul><li>2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled, diced, and boiled in salted water until tender
    </li>
    <li>1 pound ground beef
    </li>
    <li>1/2  medium yellow onion, sliced thin
    </li>
    <li>1/3 cup pickled jalapenos, chopped
    </li>
    <li>3 tablespoons Old Bay
    </li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter
    </li>
    <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt
    </li>
    <li>1 teaspoon black pepper
    </li>
    <li>12 slices American cheese
    </li>
    <li>Ketchup
    </li>
    <li>Mustard</li>
    <li>Olive oil for baking
    </li></ul>

    <h5>Make the Dough</h5>
    <ol><li>Whisk flour, salt, and baking powder together in a bowl. Make a well in the center.</li>
    <li>Add the beaten egg, vinegar, oil, and warm water. Mix by hand until the dough pulls together.</li>
    <li>Turn the dough out onto the counter and knead until soft, smooth, and elastic. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
    </li></ol>
    <h5>Make the Filling</h5>
    <ol><li>Begin by boiling the potatoes until they can be pierced with a fork. Drain the potatoes and mash them with a potato masher or fork. You don’t need smooth perfect mashed potatoes. Embrace a few lumps. Mix in 1 tablespoon Old Bay, butter, salt & pepper. Set aside. 

    </li>
    <li>Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion, ground beef, and 1 tablespoon Old Bay. Cook undisturbed until it develops a crust, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip with a spatula, breaking up the meat. Add in the jalapenos and the remaining Old Bay. Stir to combine & continue cooking until the ground beef is crispy, about 3-5 minutes.

    </li>
    <li>Add the ground beef mixture to the bowl with the potatoes. Stir to combine thoroughly. Place the bowl in the fridge to cool completely.

    </li></ol>
    <h5>Assemble the Knishes</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F. Line two baking sheets with Silpats or parchment paper. Take the dough from the fridge and let it come to room temperature.

        </li>
        <li>Divide the dough in half & flatten one half into a rectangle on a floured surface. Roll out into a larger rectangle about 1/8-inch thick, pulling the corners as needed. The key is to make the dough as thin as possible.

        </li>
        <li>Place 6 slices of American cheese along one long end, about 3 inches from the edges. Drizzle with ketchup & mustard. Top with 2-3 cups of filling pressed tightly into a long sausage shape across the cheese. Beat the egg with water and brush over the opposite end and a little on the sides. Starting with the filling side, roll up toward the egg-washed side. Press in the filling; rolling as tightly as possible, and then roll over so the seam side is on the bottom.

        </li>
        <li>Trim off excess dough from the ends. Cut the dough into 8 equal pieces. Lightly flour your hands and seal the top & bottom of each knish by pinching them shut. Squish down the top and tuck everything into the center to form a round knish. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling. Brush the bottoms with olive oil and place them on the prepared baking sheets. Brush the tops in the egg wash.

        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 15 minutes. Rotate trays and cook until golden brown, about another 15 minutes. Let cool until just warm or room temperature.

        </li>
    </ol>

    </li></ol>
    <p>Just mix it all in a bowl.</p>
